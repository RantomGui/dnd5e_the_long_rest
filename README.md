# dnd5e_the_long_rest

what is this?

I haven't been a fan of short rests since I started playing DnD5e. After seeing this video by Treantmonk on how the game might look like without features that reacharge on a short rest I decided to think about it and especially the features not mentioned in the video https://youtu.be/u6Ym5i1tn7I.

The PDF contains my proposed changes to the 5e system, covering feats, classes and subclasses, from the PHB, Xanathar's, Tasha's, Sword coast adventurer's guide, Fitzban's and Van Richten's.
I'll be running with short rests that allow spending hit dice and take 5 minutes per hit die spent.

The JavaScript file contains all these changes for mpmb's character sheet, which can be found here: https://www.flapkan.com/#download.
The file is tested with and assumes that the all_WotC_published (downloaded 28/07/2022) is imported into the sheet. It can (at the time of writing) be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/mpmb/wiki/index/scriptindex
